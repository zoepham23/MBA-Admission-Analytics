# MBA-Admission-Analytics
## Project Introduction
As someone interested in the decision-making behind competitive graduate programs, I was curious to explore what factors might influence admission into the Wharton School of Business—one of the top MBA programs in the U.S. Through this project, I aim to uncover data-driven insights on how elements like GPA, GMAT scores, work experience, and demographics relate to admission outcomes. My goal is to better understand the admissions landscape and share findings that may be helpful for prospective applicants.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project is included in this repository as [`MBA.csv`](MBA.csv).  

- **Source:** [Kaggle – MBA Admission Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/taweilo/mba-admission-dataset)  
- **Note:** The dataset is synthetic, generated from Wharton Class of 2025 statistics

## Research Questions
Some research questions I use to guide the exploratory stage are:

1. How do GPA and GMAT scores correlate with admission status?
2. Are applicants from certain undergraduate majors (Business, STEM) more likely to be admitted?
3. What is the distribution of admission across gender, race, and international status?
4. Does demographic background impact admission rates?
5. Does the number of years of work experience correlate with higher admission rates?
6. Which industries have the highest proportion of admitted applicants?
